The relationship between Europe and the USA in the aftermath of the Trump presidency is also in flux. All this is taking place while Europe has been reeling from the global financial crisis, with stringent austerity measures in some countries leading to great social deprivation and political unrest. This has created a resurgent right wing, which blames Europe's ills on immigrant populations, especially the Islamic community.

A touchstone of our inquiry will be the vexed relationship between “modernity” as a historical condition and “modernism” as a cultural movement. What does it mean to be modern? What happens to art when traditional beliefs and ways of life enter a period of permanent crisis – a period, that is, when “all that is solid melts into air”?

From producers to consumers, from studio moguls to directors, to critics, fans and aficionados, the notion of genre is used to help determine a film’s meaning. Genre films work within and have the opportunity to reflect upon society’s primary myths of identity and individuality, freedoms and responsibilities, cultural stability, and social change. This course will consider some of the most fascinating questions raised by genre films: What are the parameters for standardization and innovation within film genres? How do individual filmmakers rework the conventions of a genre to maintain its relevance to their time? In what sense can film genres operate as instigators of change?

But things are different today: technology has advanced to the point where the fascinating and troubling questions raised by Artificial Intelligence must be addressed head-on. Some of those we consider in this course are foundational questions in the philosophy of mind. What is intelligence, and can machines really possess it? Could it be that—as many have argued—we ourselves are no more than intelligent machines (designed by evolution rather than engineers)? How do technologies such as artificial neural networks and machine learning change our understanding of the mind? Others are ethical, social, and political. What are the risks associated with these technologies, and how can we minimise them? What are their benefits, and how can we ensure that they are equitably shared? Conversely, assuming that true A.I. is possible, what are our own moral obligations towards our non-human but intelligent creations?"

Yet despite – or perhaps because of – Australia’s vast distance from the Global North, it has attracted many notable visitors across its history as a settler colony. Whether prompted by colonial conquest, fascination with Indigenous peoples, scientific curiosity, royal or political duties, the pursuit of literary or sporting inspiration, or an enthusiastic local fanbase, famous visitors have included Charles Darwin, Mark Twain, Joseph Conrad, Paul Robeson, DH Lawrence, Eleanor Roosevelt, Queen Elizabeth II, The Beatles, Marina Abramović and Nelson Mandela.

The course is organized thematically. It starts by framing East Asia in terms of its history of globalization through cultural and religious interaction. The course then turns to fundamental cultural commonalities centring on statecraft, institutions, education and notions of civilization that united and divided the region. Cross cultural comparisons among China, Japan, and Korea highlight the global and regional dimensions of cultural change in East Asia. These frame cultural similarities and differences that influenced the varying approaches to modernity taken by Chinese, Japanese and Korean activists when East Asia came under increasing pressure from the West. The formation of nation-state ideologies along Western lines led to evolving conceptions of their place in the world, the meaning of culture, the role of commerce, and the relationship of the individual to the state. But in the era of globalization, these issues are situated in a post-nation-state framework."

Such development is often seen a synonym of progress; however, over the past few decades it has been increasingly recognised that such rapid change has produced an uneven social geography – marginalising significant populations – while also intensively degrading and polluting different environments. We will discuss how the idea of sustainable development has emerged as a response to this conundrum – an effort to redirect economic growth to produced more socially just and environmentally benign outcomes. The path to a sustainable future, however, is not straightforward, as environmental, social and economic issues are ultimately situated in contested political realms. In this course, you will study how human-environment interconnections, across different scales and in different contexts, come together to demonstrate how environmental issues are situated in, and shaped by political and economic contexts. This will include engaging with a number of key sustainability debates as well as the in-depth study of different examples from around the world."

At the same time, International Relations scholars have argued that these narrow, state-centric and military-centric approaches to security – and the concepts and discourses they rely on – are deeply implicated in the ‘imperial-racial origins of IR’ and unable to engage with contemporary security concerns related to issues such as climate justice, environmental security, food security, the Black Lives Matter movement, disinformation, ethnic strife, the evolution of terrorism, the corollaries of intervention, and the securitisation of migrants and refugees, amongst others. This course provides a critical evaluation of the traditional security studies scholarship, and introduces students to critical approaches to security, including feminist, postcolonial, poststructuralist, and emancipatory theoretical frameworks that extend beyond warfare and examine diverse modern security issues. We will analyse different sets of critical theoretical approaches and explore their analytical utility (as well as any biases/ blind spots) by investigating relevant case studies and contemporary security dilemmas. Overall, the course will enable you to recognise core differences between critical security scholarship and traditional security studies; identify and evaluate critical theories of security, and apply them to contemporary events and issues in global politics."

By starting in the Ancient world, you will learn that people and societies have not always understood sexual behaviour to equate with a sexual identity, such as ‘homosexual’ or ‘heterosexual’. ‘Sexuality’ then is a modern phenomenon. To comprehend this, we will examine why masturbation suddenly became a very big ‘problem’ in the 18th century and why sex was increasingly regulated from the 19th century. We chart the growth of new forms of sexual knowledge and ponder feminist critiques of Freud and other sex ‘experts’. We wind up in the twentieth century, with not one but several sexual revolutions. The course is designed for students in Women’s and Gender Studies and in History, but should appeal to anybody with an interest in one of the most studied and discussed aspects of modern life."

This course aims to take account of the abiding relevance of Austen's work in the early 21st century in two distinct but related ways. On the one hand, it focuses on Austen's juvenilia and novels as social and cultural products of their time. It examines how her works interact self-consciously with contemporary romantic, gothic and sentimental fiction as well as 'converse' with each other to form a dynamic and intellectually challenging body of work. On a more theoretical level, it explores the various components of Austen's literary style that allow her to speak to present-day readers: her use of irony, her ability to illuminate the subtle transformation of character over time, and her unique intermingling of romance and realism. Through these two lenses, the module demonstrates the continuing relevance of Austen's literary and moral worldview."

Theory, understood in its original Greek sense of theorein - ‘a way of seeing’ - serves as our compass for analyzing the myriad ways that meaning can emerge from literary and visual signs. The course takes you through the principal methods of the literary critical tradition, such as feminism, psychoanalysis, Marxism and deconstruction. You will also have the chance to put these methods into practice, enlivening them with ideas of embodiment, materiality, sexuality, power, representation, ideology, and many others. Providing a solid foundation for future higher degree research, the goal of the course is not only to expose you to some influential currents in the ways people have thought about literature, but also for you to pirate these theories for your own theoretical exploits in a daring programme of critical inquiry, fashioning new ways of seeing and reading the ever-changing sign systems of the contemporary world."

In Gothic fiction nothing is ever certain. The domestic and familiar are merely comforting illusions that veil the darker reality of unspoken fears and desires.  Home, city, work, identity, sexuality, the body and the mind are all sites that are open to the destabilising play and uncanny effects of the Gothic imagination as this course’s selected texts, films and TV series, which range from the popular to the canonical, exemplify.       "

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the genre that we often colloquially refer to as the “coming-of-age story,” from its origins in the Romantic era to its most recent iterations in contemporary fiction and film. We will consider how new ideas about youth and education gave the genre its initial impetus but also how 20th and 21st century writers and filmmakers disrupted and critiqued the assumptions that informed the first bildungsromans. By studying a diverse selection of classic and contemporary texts alongside a range of key theoretical readings, you will acquire a thorough understanding of the bildungsroman as a genre and learn how narrative shapes our beliefs about youth, maturity and coming of age.  "

The course will reflect on the histories of the nuclear age together with contemporary developments in nuclear engineering in Australia and internationally. A notable aspect of the development of nuclear technologies – both civilian and military – throughout the twentieth century has been the parallel development of frameworks for understanding questions of limits, responsibility and ethics in science. These include, for example, the formation of nuclear scientists active in campaigns around nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation – the 1957 Pugwash Conference for example – to more contemporary frameworks inspired by work in technological ethics and the social studies of science and technology. This course will draw upon key episodes in Australia’s history of engagement with the nuclear age – including British, American and French weapons testing, debates surrounding the construction of a civil nuclear power capability, uranium mining, and proposals for the construction of deep geological storage facilities to consider relevant ethical, environmental and societal questions. Case studies drawn from key episodes in Australia’s nuclear history will be used to introduce you to thinking across the humanities and social science around the ethical, environmental and societal dimensions of nuclear technology and engage you in key contemporary debates"

A good engineer has complex technical skills, but also creative skills, project management and teamworking skills, and knowledge of professional ethical standards in design. DESN2000 aims to further develop your skills in engineering design with a particular focus on the early stages, where innovative concepts are created in response to open-ended problems. These skills will be developed in the context of an engineering project, with a focus on three areas: (1) research techniques needed to understand design problems and discover concepts, (2) technical skills needed to build a concept, and (3) evaluation methods for evaluating the concept. Alongside the development of design skills, the course also aims to develop your readiness for professional practice by deepening your understanding and skills in effective project management, teamwork and communication. The course builds on the teamwork, communication, and project management skills introduced in DESN1000. Skills learned in DESN2000 are further deepened in DESN3000, which will develop skills for managing design in commercial context.

DESN3000,DESN3000Undergraduate,Strategic Design Innovation,Faculty of Engineering,Faculty of Engineering,,"strategic,design,innovation,stra,management",,,,,,Course Link,,"Over the last three decades design innovation has become strategic: success in design requires a strategy for managing the broader problems of innovation. As design has gained importance, it also has become relevant to a wide array of stakeholders. This has added complexity to the way in which design should be undertaken. Design is an important instrument of innovation in manufacturing and service industries, as well as in public, semi-public and humanitarian organisations. These environments set many types of requirements for innovation, including price points, brand requirements, competition, technological and brand legacies, government regulations, and ethics. They almost always require an analysis of the ethical environment, which is often but not always coded into professional rules and regulations. These environments are usually ambiguous, dynamic and reactive, and designers cannot control them. To innovate in these environments, designers need strategies for identifying and managing these contextual requirements. DESN3000 teaches you skills in strategic design innovation. These include: skills for capturing the boundary conditions that create conditions for innovation; skills for creating design concepts that provide a fit to the strategic environment; skills for creating innovation strategies that help them to innovate in with multiple stakeholders who often have conflicting values and shifting interests; skills for identifying ethical problems involved in design decisions; and skills for managing teams and projects in strategic context."
